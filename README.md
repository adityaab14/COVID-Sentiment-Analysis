# COVID-Sentiment-Analysis

Along with the Coronavirus pandemic, another crisis has manifested itself in the form of mass fear and panic phenomena, fueled by incomplete and often inaccurate information. There is therefore a tremendous need to address and better understand COVID-19â€™s informational crisis and gauge public sentiment, so that appropriate messaging and policy decisions can be implemented.
Four critical issues: 
(1) public sentiment associated with the progress of Coronavirus and COVID-19, 
(2) the use of Twitter data, namely Tweets, for sentiment analysis, 
(3) descriptive textual analytics and textual data visualization, and 
(4) comparison of textual classification mechanisms used in artificial intelligence (AI). 
The rapid spread of Coronavirus and COVID-19 infections have created a strong need for discovering efficient analytics methods for understanding the flow of information and the development of mass sentiment in pandemic scenarios. While there are numerous initiatives analyzing healthcare, preventative, care and recovery, economic and network data, there has been relatively little emphasis on the analysis of aggregate personal level and social media communications.

The rise in emphasis on AI methods for textual analytics and NLP followed the tremendous increase in public reliance on social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, blogging, and LinkedIn) for information, rather than on the traditional news agencies. People express their opinions, moods, and activities on social media about diverse social phenomena (e.g., health, natural hazards, cultural dynamics, and social trends) due to personal connectivity, network effects, limited costs and easy access.
